Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jdupes is a program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate files
such as deleting, hard linking, symlinking, and block-level deduplication
(also known as "dedupe" or "reflink"). It is faster than most other duplicate
scanners. It prioritizes data safety over performance while also giving
expert users access to advanced (and sometimes dangerous) features.
