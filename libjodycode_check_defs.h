/* Minimum libjodycode feature level required
 * You can copy this from the current libjodycode feature level; however,
 * the ideal number is the lowest number that is still compatible. For
 * example: in level 1 the alarm API sets the "ring" to 1 like a flag
 * while the level 2 alarm API increments "ring" when triggered to tell
 * the application how many alarms have been triggered since reset. For
 * applications that don't care about the number of alarms or that work
 * properly without that info, level 1 minimum is fine; those that rely
 * on the newer behavior must specify a minimum level of 2. */
#define MY_FEATURELEVEL_REQ 2

/* API sub-version requirements
 * For any libjodycode API you use, copy its number from libjodycode.h to
 * this list.
 * To indicate you don't use an API, set it to 0.
 * To auto-fill the API numbers you're building against, set it to 255.
 * Any number not matching libjodycode will cause an error exit. */
